i really like this website, this type o vibe
- have in interactable map? so users can click a part of japan and it will take them straight to that section
- have a normal gallery option (keep menu)
- dont have it be an endless scroll, maybe have like a timeline bar on th side so users can skip to a specific part?

********   https://kurokawawonderland.jp/   ********
this menu is sick
- split into two?? have "headers" and then info sides
- smooth transitions, i think its just linking to another part of one long page and transitioning there

********   https://homunculus.jp/   ********
the menu on this is also really cool
- have timeline like this menu?
- i like having an easy clean home screen instead of going straight to content
- have the initial to go like the page after home on this website, have options on where to go or a final option thats a timeline scroll?

********   https://emergencemagazine.org/feature/shikoku-pilgrimage/#/index   ********
have a timeline like the contents page here?
i like how when you hover over credits it shows more info instead of having it always displayed

initial scroll for this is cute, having static and dynamic elements with scroll



have menu button to the side instead of in header????
header that disappears when scroll?? reappears when scroll up?
