i really like this website, this type o vibe
- have in interactable map? so users can click a part of japan and it will take them straight to that section
- have a normal gallery option (keep menu)
- dont have it be an endless scroll, maybe have like a timeline bar on th side so users can skip to a specific part?

this menu is sick
- split into two?? have "headers" and then info sides
- smooth transitions, i think its just linking to another part of one long page and transitioning there
