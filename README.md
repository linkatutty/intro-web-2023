## **Hello!** Welcome to my README! This read me contains all information pertaining to my website. My GitHub repository contains multiple files that are all funtional parts of my site. This website demonstrates my competency in the use of fundamental components of web pages, basic/client server communication, programming languages and industry relevant tools and workflows.

### I created this website as a way to showcase a variety of photos that I have taken during my many trips back home to Japan. I was initially a little too ambitious and therefore have scaled it down to a handful of photos from winter, but in the future i intend on expanding on this website to incorporate more photos, different season, and add new pages.

## Website layout
### I have intentionally left elements of traditional websites out of this one as a stylistic choice, and as to better highlight the photos. This includes not adding a header to any page, leaving only the content and a menu button that is alwasy visible. The home page consists of four photos from Unsplash, and a simple title and blurb. The gallery currently has fourteen photos, which I have arranged as to not be in a traditional grid. I wanted the gallery to evoke more of a feeling of a traditional scrapbook than the ordered camera roll we often see now.

## Fetching
### I fetched four photos from the Unsplash library. As I wanted to have better control over the photos, I chose to fetch in a slightly more complicated way by utilising Unsplash API's user likes function. All fetching code is in the same section of which I will leave a screenshot below, fig. 1.
    
## Current bugs
### So far, the biggest bugs I have noticed are to do with the menu and menu buttons. The first is that the font icon for the close menu button is above the button checkbox, meaning that the menu can only be closed by pointing the cursor just to the side of the button. I will provide a screenshot to this below, fig. 2. The second is that when an option is chosen on the menu, the menu will not automaticallty close, and the ssure must manually close it to access the content. 
### I also at one point had an issue where if I were to refresh the page while in the gallery, the CSS work for that page would break. The only way to fix this was by going back to the home page and refreshing again. I believe that I have fixed this bug, but I still wanted to mention it, incase it happens again. A screenshot of this is also below, fig. 3.
